## Tech Stack

- Frontend: For the frontend, I used Next.js with TypeScript to build a scalable and efficient user interface. For UI design and styling, I integrated Tailwind CSS which provides flexible and responsive layout.

- Backend: The backend is built with Next.js, using Prisma ORM for seamless, type-safe interaction with the MongoDB database. Prisma ensures smooth and reliable database management with type safety.

- User Authentication: I implemented Google and GitHub authentication using the NextAuth.js library, providing a secure and easy login process for users.

- Form Handling: For form handling, I utilized React Hook Form, a flexible and performant library that simplifies form management and validation.

- Image Storage: To manage and store images efficiently, I integrated Cloudinary, a cloud-based service for uploading, storing, and delivering images.
